# Introduction

PagoPA's software repositories are organized in three different GitHub organizations:
- active projects are maintained [**@pagopa**](https://github.com/pagopa);
- archived projects are stored [**@pagopa-archive**](https://github.com/pagopa-archive);
- R&D projects are developed here [**@pagopa-research**](https://github.com/pagopa-research).  

As such, this organization includes several repositories with research and development purposes.  This means that they may be undergoing deep changes, or that they may be abandoned at any time.  For this reason, we do not provide any support for these repositories. Furthermore, please note that the code in these repositories is not production-ready and should not be used in any production environments.

## Contacts
Should you have any inquiry regarding the archived projects, please open an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/pagopa-research/.github/issues).
